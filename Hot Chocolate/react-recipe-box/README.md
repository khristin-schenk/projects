# React Recipe Box

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thepeted/pen/VaajNX](https://codepen.io/thepeted/pen/VaajNX).

Create, edit and delete your own recipes.  Data is saved to local storage.

There are a few nifty features:

* The main menu is disabled when adding or editing a recipe.
* If there are less than 3 cards, the stack behind will change accordingly.
* If the user doesn't select an image, the card will fall back to a placeholder.

Really enjoying learning React - ES2015 next time!

I created this project as part of the FreeCodeCamp Curriculum: http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-recipe-box
