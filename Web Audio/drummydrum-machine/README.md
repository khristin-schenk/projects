# Drummy - Drum Machine

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thepeted/pen/deKPgW](https://codepen.io/thepeted/pen/deKPgW).

Fell in love with [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/3169399-Drummy-Drum-Machine-for-Mac) dribble shot by [elichi](https://dribbble.com/elechi) so I decided to make it.

Only seems to work close to OK in Chrome at the moment. 
 We're playing uncompressed wavs via the media element, so its kinda impressive it works at all.  Ripe for optimisation someday - fork away!
