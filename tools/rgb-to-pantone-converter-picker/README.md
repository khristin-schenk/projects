# RGB-to-Pantone Converter / Picker

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/phennessey/pen/mdKdoYZ](https://codepen.io/phennessey/pen/mdKdoYZ).

This pen lets you input any RGB value and see a list of Pantone Coated color matches, with the closest match on the right. Enable Pantone Pastels or Neons to this as well! They will filter into your results.

This is something I've never found a satisfactory version of online. Why do so many of these color pickers not order the colors by closeness? Or force you to pick arbitrary color distances?? So annoying!

These color values are from the latest V4 Pantone Coated library.
